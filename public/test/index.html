            <p><strong>React Components</strong> - re-usable and independent pieces of React code that comprise the User Interface.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>ES6 importing and exporting - </strong>a new syntax for sharing code between separate files. Used in cases like `import React from ‘react’`</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>State - </strong>the pertinent data to an application. Each component has its local state as long as you declare add the constructor to a Component and declare its state object.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Updating State - </strong>When updating state, make sure to <strong>never</strong> mutate state directly. Doing so will lead to fatal errors in your application. Instead, re-declare new instances of state arrays or objects and use the setState() function to update state.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Props - </strong>similar to state, except this data inherits from parent component specifying pieces of state as properties.</p>

          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>LifeCycle Methods - </strong>events in React components that trigger in cases such as rendering on or off the screen, or during state updates. One example is the `componentDidMount()` lifeCycle hook.</p>

          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Redux</strong> - A JavaScript library which allows React applications to extract their data into one giant store. </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Three Steps to Adding Redux</strong> -  1) Define a redux constant. 2) Add an Action Creator. 3) Amend or Add a Reducer</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Redux</strong> <strong>Constants</strong> - Constants that allow actions and reducers in redux to listen to the same type to ensure that it recognizes true data.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Action</strong> <strong>Creators</strong> - methods that create and return actions for reducers to manipulate the redux store.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Actions</strong> - the plain JavaScript object that Action Creators return. Must include a type parameter with a Redux constant and a certain data payload.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Reducers</strong> - extract the Redux logic for the store into functions that handle actions and return pieces of the state.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Provider</strong> - a component at the root of your redux application that provides the redux store globally.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>mapDispatchToProps</strong> - allows action creators to become accessible within React Components through this.props.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>mapStateToProps</strong> - allows reducers in the redux store to become accessible within React Components through this.props.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>bindActionCreators</strong> - a redux method that allows action creators to store within this.props in React Components.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong> - string names that map string values stored on the browser. Allows applications to keep a local history of data on a browser</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Web Requests </strong>- web requests allow developers to use endpoints to grab data from the web, and post data to databases. Web requests have various types including ‘GET’ and ‘POST’.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>APIs</strong> - packages hosted by companies that allow developers and applications to interact with large databases or systems. Usually includes a series of methods that allow the developer to interact with it in a certain way, and will typically have accompanying documentation.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Fetch</strong> - a method within JavaScript which enables React developers to interact with APIs and web requests through a web request.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Flexbox</strong> - a form of styling often used in React applications that allows components and elements to expand based on portions of the screen. Allows dynamic resizing over hard-coding pixel sizes that may not fit on certain devices.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Audio</strong> - a native JavaScript object that allows for playing, pausing, and manipulation of sound files.</p>

          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>CSS Animations</strong> - a css3 feature that allows for transitions from one css class to another.</p>

          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Firebase</strong> - a service provided by google that allows for applications to have real-time databases as well as full authentication.</p>

          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>Firebase</strong> <strong>references</strong> - map to locations on a firebase database to allow manipulation of data through multiple methods.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <p><strong>browserHistory</strong> - allows React applications to keep track of the user navigation throughout the application by storing visited urls. Also allows the application to handle redirecting the user to specific components.</p>
